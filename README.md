I design and build whatever I can imagine.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are Iâ€™ll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is react, typescript, tailwind, and framer motion. My favorite tools are figma, apple notes, and procreate on my iPad.

Iâ€™ve got a bunch of pinned projects, but my favorite is the Anime Scene Gallery.

Iâ€™ve built over 100 public repos, but privately.. itâ€™s probably more than 200 at this point.

Current Goals:
- Finish Harvard's CS50
- Start learning DSA; Daily LeetCode
- Creating 20 projects in Frontend Mentor
